# ðŸ˜‡ PRIVATE ðŸ˜‡

## FiveM scaffolding when creating nox scripts ðŸ˜‡


This is a public repository to allow anyone to access to the private repositories to easily create a nox script from scratch

A basic mod will be created with unit tests and dynamic server and core


Run the following command in your empty folder (It does not have to be empty the code does check if a basic project already exists then skips the starting steps)
```bash
source <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NoX-Scripts-and-Things/fivem-nox-public/master/scripts/setup-project-scaffolding.sh)
```

Next run the following command 

```
.source/fivem-nox-public/scripts/create-starter-code.sh
```

[Optional] Run the following command to initials your git for now to enable folder highlighting
```git
git init
```

feel free to run this everytime you want to keep your scaffolding modules on the latest version
